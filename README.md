# Sample Dataspecer specifications
A repository for sample specifications from [Dataspecer](https://dataspecer.com), using the [Data Specification Vocabulary (DSV)](https://w3id.org/dsv#) for Application profile modeling.

- [DCAT 3 Default Application Profile](dcat-dap/), compare with the original [Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) - Version 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/). You can see e.g. differences between [DCAT3.ttl](https://www.w3.org/ns/dcat3.ttl) and actual definitions in the document, and description of the application profile (reuse of properties from different vocabularies) in the attached DSV file.
- [DCAT-AP 3.0](dcat-ap/), compare with the original [DCAT-AP 3.0](https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0/). See the profiling hierarchy from DCAT-AP to DCAT-DAP (above).

You can either:
Import the spec to [Dataspecer](https://dataspecer.com) as is using import functionality and the spec URL, e.g. `https://mff-uk.github.io/specifications/dcat-ap`, or create a new application profile of the spec.
